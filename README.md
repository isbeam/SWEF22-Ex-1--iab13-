Block Of Text:
Today I remembered how to use Terminal and learned how to operate through GIT. I created a public 
repository and worked through merging new forks with it as well as working through bugs when 
trying to merge two new forks at once. I learned how to fork and work with someone else's repo and 
how collaboration isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I learned how to make a branch to 
test new features and then on completion of those featers, I learned how to merge the branch back 
into the main. 
 ```

 Some commands I used were
 - List
 - git commit -a -m "Message"
 - git push/pull
 - git branch
